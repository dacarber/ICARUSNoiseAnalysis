    "`WireCell` uses the FFT spectra of both the coherent and intrinsic noise components as input to the noise model. Each group of 32 comprised of `wired` channels is configured to have its own distinct spectra for each of the coherent and intrinsic components. The analysis module that produces these spectra has already done the down-sampling of 32 channels to a single spectra, so all that is required is to retrieve each group and place it in the correct location and format within the `WireCell` configuration file. Code from Sergey Martynenko was adapted to work with this particular analysis output format.\n",

    "Each TPC and each component has a separate JSON configuration file (total = 8), which must be compressed prior to handing it to `WireCell`. The helper methods from `utilities.py` handle the formatting. This JSON format is documented below:\n",
