    "`WireCell` uses the FFT spectra of both the coherent and intrinsic noise components as input to the noise model. Each group of 64 comprised wholly or partially of `wired` channels is configured to have its own distinct spectra for each of the coherent and intrinsic components. The analysis module that produces these spectra has already done the down-sampling of 32 channels to a single spectra, so all that is required is to retrieve each group and place it in the correct location and format within the `WireCell` configuration file. Code from Sergey Martynenko was adapted to work with this particular analysis output format.\n",

    "Each TPC and each component has a separate JSON configuration file (total = 8), which must be compressed prior to handing it to `WireCell`. The helper methods from `utilities.py` handle the formatting. This JSON format is documented below:\n",

The `get_blocks_tpc` function handles the organization of spectra and other parameters into a list of dictionaries for the requested TPC and component type. We can then write these blocks to a file using the `write_blocks` function. We can optionally choose to compress this to a `.bz2` file which, while necessary when using as input to `WireCell`, might not be useful for debugging."
